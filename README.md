# Final Assignment for MA-Level Course 'Statistics for International Relations Research I'

As part of this final project, I had to use data from the University of Gothenburg's Quality of Government Standard Dataset (https://www.gu.se/en/quality-government/qog-data/data-downloads/standard-dataset). 

After some brief wrangling, I produced some descriptive statistics, including a Histogram and World Map of sampled countries.

Then, I conducted regression analyses and represented my findings graphically with interaction plots and marginal effects plots.

For the last section, I conducted some standard regression diagnostics: Shapiro-Wilk test for Normality, Breusch-Pegan test for Homoscedasticity, Durbin-Watson test for Independence, Variance-Inflation-Factors for Multicollinearity, and finding influence points.
